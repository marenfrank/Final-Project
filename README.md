# Final Project for CSC-336
My final project for Web Programming is a mobile app that suggests a song for you on Spotify. Users can choose parameters or go completely random to get a
new song to have stuck in their head!

# Features
* It uses Spotify's API to pull songs by genre and playlist

# Credits
* Helper functions made by Prof. Bei Xiao
