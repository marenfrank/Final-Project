# Final Project for CSC-336
My final project for CSC-336: Web Programming is a mobile app that finds the user's location and generates a weather report for them.

# Features
* Locates user's desired coordinates
* Uses desired coordinates to develop personalized weather report
* Uses diagrams and data chart to display weather report
* Users can save their locations and weather data for later

# Credits
* Helper functions made by Prof. Bei Xiao
* [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) Geocoding API to find latitude and longitude of user's location
* [7Timer!](http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en) API to generate a weather report based off coordinates given by OpenCage
