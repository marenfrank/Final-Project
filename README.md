# Final Project for CSC-336
My final project for Web Programming is a mobile app that suggests a song for you on Spotify. It uses Spotify's API to pull songs by genre and playlist
to give listeners a different listening experience. Users can also choose the random button to get a random song to listen not based off a selected genre or playlist!
