# Final Project for CSC-336
My final project for Web Programming is a mobile app that find's the user's location and generates a weather report for them.

# Features
* It uses Spotify's API to pull songs by genre and playlist

# Credits
* Helper functions made by Prof. Bei Xiao
* Uses [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) Geocoding API to find latitude and longitude of user's location
* Uses [7Timer!](http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en) API to generate a weather report based off coordinates given by OpenCage
